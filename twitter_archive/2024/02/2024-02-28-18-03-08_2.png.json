    "description": "An illustration of an analog fuel gauge: the gauge is circular with the letter E on the left side (indicating the fuel tank is empty) and an F on the right side (indicating the tank is full) with a gas pump symbol in the center to denote that it is the fuel gauge; there are three thick rectangles - one each above the E, gas pump symbol, and F - and two thin rectangles between the thick ones. The red indicator is pointing all the way to the left, partially obscuring the E.",
