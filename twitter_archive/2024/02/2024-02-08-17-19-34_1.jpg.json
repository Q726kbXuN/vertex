    "description": "A collection of circles in a large, wide, slightly lumpy rectangular formation; there are two small triangular formations extending downwards from the bottom corners of the rectangular formation with the points at the tops and a trapezoidal formation below the rectangular formation between the two triangular formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark gray triangle below the center of the rectangular formation and another dark gray triangle on the right side.",
