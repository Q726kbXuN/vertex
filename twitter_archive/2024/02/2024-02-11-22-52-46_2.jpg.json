    "description": "An illustration of the sculpture \"Quatre Blancs\" (1976) by artist Alexander Calder. The sculpture consists of several pieces of thin metal in various shapes: the base is made up of a black triangular piece that has an S-curved right side with a red, roughly rectangular piece that tapers to a triangular point placed perpendicular to the black triangular piece; a thin red rod balances on the tip of the triangular base; a blue circle connects to the left end of the rod; the right end of the rod connects to three smaller red metal rods with four white roughly triangular shapes attached.",
