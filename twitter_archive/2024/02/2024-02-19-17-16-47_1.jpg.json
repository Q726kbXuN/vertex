    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly trapezoidal formation with the longer side on top above a roughly circular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a grayish-dark blue triangle toward the top right corner of the trapezoidal formation and a grayish-light purple triangle on the left side of the circular formation. There is a circle on the right side of the circular formation that is black with the number 4 in white in the center; this is my error, accidentally highlighting that circle (all other circles are white with the numbers in black in the centers).",
