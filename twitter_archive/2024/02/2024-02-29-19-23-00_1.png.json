    "description": "A collection of circles in a parabola-shaped line formation with three thin almond-shaped formations pointing downwards from the bottom of the parabola-shaped line. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark blue triangle on the left side of the parabola-shaped line formation where it meets the leftmost almond-shaped formation and a smaller dark blue triangle on the right side of the rightmost almond-shaped formation.",
