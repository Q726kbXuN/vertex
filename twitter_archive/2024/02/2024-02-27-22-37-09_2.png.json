    "description": "An illustration of a rectangular can of processed ham with the pop-tab lid partially peeled back, revealing the ham inside; the can is various shades of blue and on the front is a dark blue label with three yellow rectangles at the top and a pinkish horizontal rectangle toward the bottom, while the lid, top and bottom edges of the tin are gold. The design of the can is that of the SPAM brand; the title of the puzzle (\"Popular in Hawaii\") is a reference to the fact that Hawaii consumes the most Spam per capita in the United States.",
