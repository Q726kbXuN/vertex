    "description": "A collection of circles in a small triangular formation atop a larger triangular formation which connects to a wide rectangular formation atop a wider, thinner rectangular formation with curved sides; there is also a very small circular formation of circles floating above the larger main formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark yellowish-green triangle toward the top right corner of the first wide rectangular formation and a smaller dark yellowish-green triangle on the left side of the longer rectangular formation.",
