    "description": "A collection of circles in a long, tilted rectangular formation; there is also a small crescent-shaped formation next to the bottom right corner of the rectangular formation with the concave side on the right. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is an orangeish-yellow triangle toward the top of the rectangular formation and a neon light blue triangle at the bottom of the crescent-shaped formation. ",
