    "description": "A collection of circles in a tall rectangular formation with rounded corners and a small crescent-shaped formation to its right; the two formations are connected by a thin rectangular formation of circles and there is a small trapezoidal formation of circles above the thin rectangular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a thin black triangle on the left side of the tall rectangular formation and a light blue triangle in the center of the thin rectangular formation.",
