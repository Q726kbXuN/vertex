    "description": "An illustration of an early model of an automobile, seen from the side: the cat has a black and pale green body; a small, rectangular passenger carriage with two windows in the door; pale green tires; and two lights, one on the front windshield and ine above the front tire. The title of the puzzle (\"Rolled out in the 1900s\") provides a timeframe for possible automobile designs upon which this Vertex is based, but there are not enough details to match any one make and model definitively.
