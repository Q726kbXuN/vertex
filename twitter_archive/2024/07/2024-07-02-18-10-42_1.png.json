    "description": "A collection of circles in a triangular formation with a thick arc-shaped formation of circles attached to the bottom right corner of the triangular formation; the arc-shaped formation ends at the bottom in a crescent-shaped formation with both points on the left side. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark blue triangle in the center of the triangular formation and a slightly lighter dark blue triangle at the top of the arc-shaped formation.",
