    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly hourglass-shaped formation; crossing through the middle of the hourglass-shaped formation is a thick checkmark-shaped formation which is itself intersected by a very thin rectangular formation of circles at the right end. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale yellowish-green triangle in the center of the top half of the hourglass-shaped formation, a pale peach-colored triangle at the bottom of the bottom half of the hourglass-shaped formation and a dark blue triangle in the center of the checkmark-shaped formation.",
