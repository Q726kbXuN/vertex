    "description": "An illustration of an astronaut floating in space: the astronaut wears a white spacesuit with a blue-visored helmet and a rectangular pack worn on their back (which could hold an oxygen tank along with other gear necessary for surviving in the vacuum of space). There is a blue sphere behind the astronaut with gray shapes on it; this could ostensibly be the Earth, looking at the outlines of North and South America. There are three four-pointed stars surrounding the astronaut, two below and one above.",
