    "description": "An illustration of a faceless man with pale skin and short black hair, wearing a black bowler hat, a black suit, long black socks, and black shoes; the man carries a briefcase in his right hand and stands on his left leg which is slightly bent while his right leg is lifted above his waist and bent at the knee. The illustration is meant to be John Cleese in the Monty Python sketch, \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\" (from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" series 2, episode 1); in the sketch, Cleese works for a fictional government ministry responsible for developing silly ways to walk.",
