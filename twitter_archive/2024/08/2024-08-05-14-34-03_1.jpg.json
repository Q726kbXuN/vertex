    "description": "A collection of circles in a tilted rectangular formation that splits in two on the right end; there is also a thin rectangular formation perpendicular to the larger one to the right. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light tan triangle to the left of the center of the larger rectangular formation and a very skinny tan triangle right above where the larger rectangular formation splits into two on the right end.",
