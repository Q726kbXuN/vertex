    "description": "A collection of circles in a very small circular formation above a triangular formation with a convex bottom; there is also a thin upside-down V shaped formation extending downwards from the center bottom of the triangular formation and a very thin line of circles below all the other formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dusty pink triangle toward the top of the triangular formation and a very pale pinkish-beige triangle in the bottom right corner.",
