    "description": "An illustration of a cuckoo clock whose case is shaped like a chalet house with a sloping green roof and brown walls; there are two weights shaped like pine cones dangling from the bottom of the clock along with a dark brown pendulum hanging between them, which tracks the seconds that pass by. On the front of the case is a trap door, which is opened to reveal a gray pantograph (an extendable arm consisting of supports crisscrossed into an X pattern that allows it to collapse and extend) with a small gray wooden cuckoo bird sitting on a platform attached to the end; there is also a small clock face below the trap door which shows the time as roughly 10:20.",
