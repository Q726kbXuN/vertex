    "description": "A collection of circles in several distinct formations: there is a small circular formation at the top of the picture, a triangular formation in the top right corner of the picture, a very small horizontal almond-shaped formation below the circular formation, and a large diamond-shaped formation with a roughly square formation extending upwards from the top right side, a small rectangular formation extending downwards from the bottom left side, and a small triangular formation below the bottom corner. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dusty blue triangle in the center of the circular formation and a dusty pale green triangle at the bottom of the diamond-shaped formation.",
