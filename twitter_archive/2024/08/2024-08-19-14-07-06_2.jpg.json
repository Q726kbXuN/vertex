    "description": "An illustration of a small sandy island surrounded by light blue water: on the island are two palm trees, each with six large fronds, with their trunks bending away from one another; two rocks, one to the left of the trees and one to the right; two small tufts of grass, one near the top of the island and one on the right side; and the letters \"SOS\" at the bottom of the island near the water. Each S is brown, potentially constructed out of large logs and the O is actually an orange and blue life preserver ring. The title of the puzzle \"Sea plea\" is a reference to the use of SOS as an international distress signal.",
