    "description": "An illustration of the Eye of Providence symbol, also known as the All-Seeing Eye: it consists of an eye enclosed in a triangle surrounded by multiple rays of light to create a circle. The eye has a heavy lid and a pink iris; the triangle is various shades of grayish-blue, perhaps to represent stones, with a thick black border; the rays of light are alternating pale purple and dusty pink. The title of the puzzle (\"Seal symbol\") is a reference to the symbol's use on the seals of various governing bodies, including the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States.",
