    "description": "A collection of circles in a crescent-shaped formation that is more densely packed with circles at the bottom than at the top; there is a long, thin semi-ovular formation extending downwards from the bottom left of the crescent-shaped formation and a slightly thicker, long semi-ovular formation extending outwards from the bottom right. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light blue triangle at the bottom left corner of the crescent-shaped formation and a darker blue triangle in the center of the larger semi-ovular formation.",
