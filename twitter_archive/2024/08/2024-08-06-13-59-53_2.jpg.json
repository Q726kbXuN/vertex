    "description": "An illustration of a loyalty card for (presumably) a pizza shop: the card is seen sideways and has an illustration of a slice of pepperoni pizza in the top left corner; two red L-shapes, one in the top right corner and the other in the bottom left corner; a black rectangle at the top of the card in the center; and six hexagons in two rows of three in the center. The top row consists of three gray hexagons, each with a white triangular hole in the center, while the bottom row consists of two gray hexagons and a gold hexagon. The hexagons represent individual visits to the pizza shop; on the sixth visit, the customer will receive some type of reward.",
