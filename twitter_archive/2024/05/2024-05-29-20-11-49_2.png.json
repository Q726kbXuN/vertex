    "description": "An illustration of a screenshot of a CAPTCHA (a contrived acronym for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\"): it is a type of digital test used online to determine if a user is a human or a bot, consisting of a random series of letters and numbers shown in a distorted image. CAPTCHAs are used to prevent spam on websites. The screenshot of the CAPTCHA consists of the following string, \"bU6u5,\" in a distorted black font with some reddish-orange spots against a pale yellow background with multiple pale gray triangles; below the CAPTCHA is a thin pale yellow bar in which a user would input the deciphered string of letters and numbers, and below that is a green bar with a white checkmark in the center for the user to click to enter the string of letters and numbers. A mouse cursor hovers over the green bar.",
