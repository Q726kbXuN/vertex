    "description": "A collection of circles in a stack of four distinct formations: a thin, tilted rectangular formation, a semi-circular formation below and to the right of the rectangular formation, a roughly square formation below the semi-circular formation, and an uneven almond-shaped formation with a deeper bottom half at the very bottom. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light blue triangle at the bottom of the rectangular formation and a very small golden yellow triangle on the left side of the almond-shaped formation.",
