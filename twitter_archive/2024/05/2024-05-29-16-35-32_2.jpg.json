    "description": "An illustration of an ancient Greek urn, specifically known as an amphora: it has an almond-shaped body with a tall, thin neck that tapers outwards for the mouth; two long, dark brown handles; and a flared base. The body of the urn is encircled by a thick brown band, then a geometric pattern underneath that, then another thick brown band beneath that, and a zigzagging line beneath that.",
