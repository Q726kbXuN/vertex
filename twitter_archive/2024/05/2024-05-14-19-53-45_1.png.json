    "description": "A collection of circles in a tilted, roughly rectangular formation that tapers to a triangular point at the top; there are also two adjacent circles below the bottom of the rectangular formation and a much smaller rectangular formation below those circles. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a green triangle toward the top of the rectangular formation and a brown triangle below the center.",
