A spoon rests in the cup of yogurt, with the handle sticking out on the right side; the tin foil lid of the cup has been partially peeled back toward the left. The top of the tin foil lid is various shades of pink and the underside is various shades of gray. The yogurt cup is mostly white with a pink label and a gray semi-circle and an illustration of a strawberry on the front.",
