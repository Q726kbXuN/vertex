    "description": "A collection of circles in a parallelogram-shaped formation; there is also a very long, thin triangular formation with the point on the bottom extending upwards from the top right corner of the parallelogram-shaped formation and a rectangular formation that tapers upwards into a triangle extending upwards from the top left corner of the parallelogram-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very dark blue triangle at the bottom of the rectangular formation and another dark blue triangle at the bottom of the parallelogram-shaped formation.",
