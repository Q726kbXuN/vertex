    "description": "An illustration of a brown mule (I'm ruling out the possibility of it being a donkey based on its tail, ears, and legs), seen in profile from the right side, with a saddle atop its back; the saddle is laden with four beige bags. The donkey has a bridle around its face and a lead attached to the bridal that attaches to the saddle; it stands atop some dirt with a small tuft of grass by its hind legs and several rocks in front of it.",
