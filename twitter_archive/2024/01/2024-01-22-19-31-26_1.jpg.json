There are three thin lines of circles extending downwards along the bottom of the teardrop-shaped formation and a curved line of circles stemming from the point of the teardrop-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a brown triangle on the left side of the teardrop-shaped formation.",
