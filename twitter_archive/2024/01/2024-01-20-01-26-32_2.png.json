    "description": "An illustration of a breakdancer performing: the breakdancer wears a white tank top, red track pants with a white stripe running down the leg, and white sneakers and is performing on an unfolded cardboard box. The breakdancer has brown skin and short, dark brown hair. The breakdancer is shown performing an dance move called an \"L-kick\" or a \"Nike\" (because the dancer's legs resemble the Nike logo): the breakdancer is balanced on their outstretched left arm, while their right arm holds onto the toes of the right foot; the dancer's right leg is outstretched to be nearly parallel with the ground and the left leg is bent at the knee.",
