    "description": "A collection of circles in a parallelogram-shaped formation with a thin, wavy loop of circles starting at the top right of the parallelogram-shaped formation and closing at the center right; there is also a very thin rectangular formation of circles going through the bottom right corner of the parallelogram-shaped formation and coming out at the center left. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a large yellowish-orange triangle in the top left corner of the parallelogram-shaped formation and a smaller yellowish-orange triangle on the right side of the thin rectangular formation.",
