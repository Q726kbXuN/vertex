    "description": "An illustration of a sumo wrestler standing in a deep, wide squat and bending forward slightly at the waist, with their left hand resting on their left knee and their right arm extended slightly past the right knee. The sumo wrestler's eyes are narrowed into an intimidating expression and their hair is tied into a top knot. The sumo wrestler is wearing a ceremonial loincloth called a \"kesho-mawashi,\" which is typically reserved for top wrestlers and worn during the opening ceremony of a tournament; the kesho-mawashi consists of a white and gray braided rope belt and a dark blue apron that covers the wearer's front. There are also four zigzagging strips of paper braided into and dangling from the rope belt; these paper streamers are similar to those placed at Shinto shrines.",
