    "description": "A collection of circles in a very roughly triangular formation with the flat side on top; there is also a thin line of circles extending upwards from the top of the triangular formation and a smaller triangular formation below it. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark greenish-blue triangle in the center of the larger triangular formation and a slightly lighter greenish-blue triangle in the bottom corner.",
