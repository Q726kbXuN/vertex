    "description": "A collection of circles in multiple formations: a triangular formation with the point on the right side above a trapezoidal formation with curved edges; a roughly ovular formation to the right of the trapezoidal formation; two V-shaped lines extending outwards from each side of the bottom of the trapezoidal formation; an upside-down capital T-shaped formation extending from the bottom of the trapezoidal formation; and a line of circles parallel to the horizontal line of the T-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a blueish-green triangle at the top of the trapezoidal formation and a dark blue triangle at the top of the upside-down capital T-shaped formation. ",
