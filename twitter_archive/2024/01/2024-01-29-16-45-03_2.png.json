    "description": "An illustration of a video baby monitor: the monitor is roughly egg-shaped with a flat bottom, allowing it to stand independently; there is an extended antenna on the top left, an almost circular video screen in the center of the top half of the monitor, a rod-shaped bar below the screen whose left half is red and whose right half is off-white, a small red dot indicating if the monitor is on, and three lines of a speaker at the bottom. The monitor is mostly off-white with a light blue oval surrounding the video screen. The screen shows a picture of a baby lying on its right side, swaddled in a white blanket; the baby has light tan skin and black hair.",
