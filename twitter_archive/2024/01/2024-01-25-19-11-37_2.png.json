    "description": "An illustration of a vuvuzela, a plastic horn typically used by spectators at football matches, especially in South Africa: the vuvuzela is red from the bell to about a third of the way down while the rest of the vuvuzela is green with a small yellow band about another third of the way down, a yellow mouthpiece, and a small red band right above the mouthpiece. There are various very thin, pale blue triangles extending from the bell of the vuvuzela, representing soundwaves.",
