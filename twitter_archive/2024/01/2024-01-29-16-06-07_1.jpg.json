    "description": "A collection of circles in three hook-shaped lines that all converge into one point with a thin line of circles extending downwards from that point; there is also a thin crescent-shaped formation of circles overlapping the bottom half of the thin line of circles. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very dark gray triangle below where the three hook-shaped lines converge and a brown triangle in the center of the crescent-shaped formation.",
