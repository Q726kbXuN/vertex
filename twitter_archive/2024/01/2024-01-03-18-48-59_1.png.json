    "description": "A collection of circles in a thin parallelogram-shaped formation with a hexagonal formation attached at the top right corner; there is also a very small teardrop-shaped formation of circles below the hexagonal formation and a very long, flattened diamond-shaped formation below all the other formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale tan triangle at the top of the hexagonal formation and a very thin pale tan triangle on the left side of the flattened diamond-shaped formation.",
