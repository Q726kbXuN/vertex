    "description": "An illustration of a necklace consisting of a blue heart-shaped gem surrounded by a thick silver border on a silver chain; there are five small bubbles surrounding the necklace, implying that it is in a body of water. The title of the puzzle (\"Titanic trinket\") is a reference to the 1997 film of the same name; in the movie, a necklace with this same design (named the \"Heart of the Ocean\") plays a large part in the plot and is ultimately dropped into the Atlantic Ocean to return to the shipwreck site.",
