    "description": "A collection of circles in two semicircular formations atop one another; the top semicircular formation has the curve on top and is smaller than the bottom semicircular formation which has the curve on the bottom. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There are two conjoined pale yellow triangles in the bottom left corner of the top semicircular formation and a large orangish-brown triangle on the right side of the top semicircular formation.",
