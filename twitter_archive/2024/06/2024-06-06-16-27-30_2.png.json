    "description": "An illustration of a bar of chocolate whose wrapper has been partially peeled away; inside, a golden foil ticket lies in front of the bar of chocolate. The chocolate bar's wrapper is mostly red with a dark brown rectangle on the front, a yellow square in the bottom left corner, and a long pale yellow rectangle running diagonally from top left to bottom right of the dark brown triangle; the wrapper has a silver foil lining. The illustration is a reference to the winning golden ticket hidden inside five Wonka Bars from Roald Dahl's children's novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964).",
