    "description": "A collection of circles in a long, tilted rectangular formation; there is a small triangular formation extending outwards from the left side of the formation and a very flat semi-circular formation extending outwards from the right side. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very dark brown triangle in the top right corner of the rectangular formation and a yellow triangle toward the bottom left corner.",
