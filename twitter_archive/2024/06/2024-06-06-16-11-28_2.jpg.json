    "description": "An illustration of a \"Simon\" toy, an electronic game consisting of a round plastic disc with four equal arced segments made of different colored plastic (the top segment is blue, then moving clockwise, the segments are green, red, and yellow) and an on-off switch in the center. The toy creates a random pattern for the player to replicate by lighting up under one of the colored plastic segments; the pattern gets progressively more complex as the game goes on.",
