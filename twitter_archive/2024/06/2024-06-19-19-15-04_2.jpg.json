    "description": "An illustration of a pair of fists extended outwards with the thumbs curled over the index fingers, with each hand wearing a set of knuckle rings: the rings on the right hand (seen on the left side of the picture) say the word \"LOVE\" in large, blocky, capital gold letters and the rings on the left hand (seen on the right side of the picture) say the word \"HATE\" in large, blocky, capital gold letters. The picture is a reference to the character Radio Raheem from Spike Lee's movie \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989), as mentioned in the title of the puzzle (\"'Do the Right Thing' rings\").",
