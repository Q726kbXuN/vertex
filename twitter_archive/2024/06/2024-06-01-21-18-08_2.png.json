    "description": "An illustration of a screenshot of the arcade video game \"Asteroids,\" which was - as hinted by the title of the puzzle (\"Atari classic\") - released by Atari in 1979. The screenshot is a long black rectangle, with rudimentary illustrations of a triangular spaceship and several multisided polygons representing asteroids of different sizes. A looping string of small white squares represents ammo shot by the spaceship at the asteroids with the intent of breaking them into smaller pieces.",
