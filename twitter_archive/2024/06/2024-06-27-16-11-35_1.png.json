    "description": "A collection of circles in a teardrop-shaped formation; there are also two lines of circles extending upwards and to the right from the top of the teardrop-shaped formation, as well as four small clusters of circles above and to the left of the teardrop-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a purplish-gray triangle at the top of the teardrop-shaped formation and a very pale pinkish-purple triangle at the top of one of the clusters of circles to the left of the teardrop-shaped formation.",
