    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly circular formation with a slightly flattened top; there is also a small ovular formation overlapping the top of the circular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very small, dark brown triangle at the top of the roughly circular formation where it meets the ovular formation and a lighter brown triangle to the right of the darker brown triangle.",
