    "description": "An illustration of a wooden cabin with its door opened, revealing a shovel and an axe hanging on an interior wall; the cabin is a simple structure with an open gable roof. There are multiple green and orange triangles scattered in front of the cabin, representing tufts of grass and weeds. The title of the puzzle (\"Built near a bed\") could imply that the cabin is near a river.",
