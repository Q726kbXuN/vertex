    "description": "An illustration of the oil painting \"Suprematism\" (1915) by Russian painter Kazimir Malevich: it consists of multiple thin rectangles of varying widths of colors overlapping one another. Despite the title of the puzzle (\"Kazimir Malevich work, 1916\") this specific painting appears to have been painted in 1915, according to the research I could find online. There were several paintings done by Malevich that had the same or similar titles.",
