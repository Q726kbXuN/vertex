    "description": "A collection of circles in a large circular formation above a small parallelogram-shaped formation; there is a thin, straight line of circles running downwards from the bottom of the circular formation, through and past the parallelogram-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a small yellowish-orange triangle toward the top of the circular formation and a very small yellow triangle below the center.",
