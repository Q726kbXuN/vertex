    "description": "An illustration of two French curves, also known as Burmester curves, alongside a yellow wooden pencil; a French curve is a template used to draw smooth curves. The larger of the two curves is often used to draw parabolas while the smaller is used for ellipses; French curves often come in a set of three and the unpictured third curve is used to draw hyperbolas.",
