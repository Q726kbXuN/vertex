    "description": "A collection of circles in a very thin rectangular formation with two triangular prism-shaped formations below each end; on top of the thin rectangular formation on the right side is a formation shaped like a very thin, upside-down capital Y with a small horizontal line of circles going through the top. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a purplish-gray triangle on the left side of the thin rectangular formation and a dark blue triangle in the center of the triangular prism-shaped formation below the right end of the rectangular formation.",
