    "description": "An illustration of an uncapped can of aerosolized insect repellant, shown spraying a cloud of spray at three flying insects (there is not enough detail in the insects to discern a species). The can is mostly a reddish-orange with a thick yellowish-orange band across the center, a thinner yellowish-orange band around the top, and a small yellowish-orange ring around the nozzle; in the center of the thick yellowish-orange band is a cartoon illustration of a flying insect with a red circle with a diagonal slash through the center over it.",
