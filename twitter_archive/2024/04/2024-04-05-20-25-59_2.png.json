    "description": "An illustration of a laptop computer that has had a full cup of water spilled over the keyboard; a white cup lies on its side to the right of the laptop. The laptop's body is a pale purple and the keyboard is black; the screen of the laptop is mostly light blue with two thick pale purple stripes going diagonally across the screen with a glitchy-looking blue triangle in the center (possibly denoting that the computer has been irreparably damaged).",
