    "description": "A collection of circles in a ring-shaped formation with two thin capital E-shaped formations of circles extending outwards in opposite directions from the ring-shaped formation, one toward the top right corner of the formation and one toward the bottom left. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a yellowish-orange triangle at the very end of the top capital E-shaped formation and another yellowish-orange triangle at the very end of the bottom capital E-shaped formation.",
