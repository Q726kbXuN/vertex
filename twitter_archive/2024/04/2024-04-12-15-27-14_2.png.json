    "description": "An illustration of a British foot guard, seen from the chest up: the guard is wearing a large and tall black bearskin cap and a red jacket that has a black collar with white trim, black shoulder badges with white trims, and two gold buttons at the top with a white stripe running vertically down the jacket to their left. The guard's eyes are not visible but their mouth is set in a stern expression. Despite the title of the puzzle (\"Beefeater topper\"), the guard is not a member of the Yeomen of the Guard - who were originally called Beefeaters - as they wear a different distinctive uniform.",
