    "description": "An illustration of a person ice fishing, with a cross-section view of the ice sheet and river below them: the fisher sits on a box (perhaps a cooler), is seen from behind, and wears a blue hat with a white pom-pom, a blue snowsuit with a white trimmed hood, and orange boots. The fisher holds a fishing rod with the line dropped into the center of a hole cut into the ice to access the river below. Underneath the sheet of ice, two fish are visible near the rod's lure, one directly below it and the other to the right.",
