    "description": "An illustration of a box truck with a Luton body (that is, an enclosed box  body that extends over the cab of the truck); this type of design is typically used for moving between homes. The truck is mostly white with an orange stripe around the top of the truck's box and an orange bottom half of the cab. The back door to the cargo area of the box is lifted up halfway, revealing two cardboard boxes taped shut inside; there is a small ramp leading from the ground up to the interior of the box.",
