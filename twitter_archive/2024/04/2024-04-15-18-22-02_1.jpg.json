    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly triangular formation with the point at the bottom; there is a thin line of circles extending upwards from the top right corner of the triangular formation, two capital L-shaped lines extending downwards from the left side of the formation (one shaped like a capital L and the other one backwards), and three clumps of circles surrounding the triangular formation) two above and one below). Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a golden yellow triangle between the two L-shaped formations of circles and a greenish-blue triangle at the bottom of the triangular formation.",
