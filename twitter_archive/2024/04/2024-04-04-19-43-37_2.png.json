    "description": "An illustration of a high striker (sometimes known as a strength tester or strongman game): it consists of a tall, thin tower made up of alternating yellow and dark red stripes with a thin stripe running up the center; a bell at the top of the tower; and a heavy yellow block base with a brown lever atop a dark blue fulcrum and a dark blue square strike pad. Hovering over the strike pad is a mallet with a dark blue head. There are two pale yellow circles and two thin dark yellow lines to the right of the mallet representing motion lines as the mallet is swung toward the strike pad.",
