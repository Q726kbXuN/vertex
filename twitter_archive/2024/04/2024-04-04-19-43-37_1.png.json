    "description": "A collection of circles in a tall, thin rectangular formation that ends in roughly pentagonal formation; to the right of the rectangular formation is a short rectangular formation with a thin triangular formation extending downwards from the bottom (it kind of looks like a slice of pizza). Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a deep yellow triangle in the center of the pentagonal formation and a small pale yellow triangle in the center of the short rectangular formation.",
