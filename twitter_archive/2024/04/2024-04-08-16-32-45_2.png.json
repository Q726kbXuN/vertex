    "description": "An illustration of the path of totality during a solar eclipse. At the bottom left corner of the picture, a little more than half of the sun is visible with the top portion missing; then, slightly above and to the right is another thinner slice of the sun, then another even thinner one above and to the right of that. In the center is a full solar eclipse, with the moon a dark circle and rays from the sun glowing in a multi-pointed star behind it. Then the inverse of the sun portions continues above and to the right of the full totality (a very thin slice of visible sun with the bottom portion missing, then a slightly thicker slice, then a little more than half of a visible sun).",
