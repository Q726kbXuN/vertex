    "description": "A collection of circles in an ovular formation with the circles tapering off into a point toward the bottom of the formation; the formation is also similar to a speech bubble as seen in comics. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pink triangle in the center of the formation and a long, dark grayish-purple triangle below the pink one.",
