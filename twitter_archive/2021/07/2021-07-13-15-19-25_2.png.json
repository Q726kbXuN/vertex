    "description": "An illustration of a rectangle which is longer than it is wide with an approximation of a Fibonacci spiral illustrated within. Inside the rectangle are various geometric shapes (triangles that together create rectangles) which create the design of a spiral that becomes smaller and tighter as it curls inwards. The shapes are varying shades of pink, purple, and blue. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
