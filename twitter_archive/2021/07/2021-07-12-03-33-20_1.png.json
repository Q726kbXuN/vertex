    "description": "A collection of circles in two distinct formations with a line of circles between them: in the bottom left corner, the circles form a circular shape and in the top right corner of the picture, the circles create a sideways H shape. Closer toward the H-part of the formation, there is a small triangular formation of circles along the line of circles connecting the two more distinct formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is one very small, thin black triangle in the center of the H-part of the formation.",
