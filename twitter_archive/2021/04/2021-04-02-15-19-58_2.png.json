    "description": "An illustration of three pieces of wood which have each been cut in such a way that they will join together; the three pieces are stacked atop one another but are not yet touching. The top piece is shaped like a dumbbell hand weight; the piece below that is shaped the same but is facing perpendicular to the top piece; the bottom piece is a tall rectangle with the top cut similarly to a castle turret. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
