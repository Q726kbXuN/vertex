There are two spouts on the face of the machine, one red signaling hot water and the other blue signaling cool. There is a thin strip of blue toward the bottom of the illustration indicating a drip tray and on the right side of the machine on the bottom half is a rectangular shape ending in a triangular point, representing a paper cone dispenser. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
