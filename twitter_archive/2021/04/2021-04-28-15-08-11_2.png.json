    "description": "An illustration of an owl perched atop a tree stump; the owl's head is turned 90 degrees counter-clockwise. It's not immediately clear what type of owl this is: the owl has brown wings and a white chest and face, with a ring of brown feathers circling its face; the owl also has golden eyes with black pupils and black coloring around its eyes and a black beak. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
