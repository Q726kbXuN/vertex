    "description": "An illustration of a single-decker bus: the body of the bus is largely shades of orange with a strip of blue-shaded triangles wrapping around the bottom of the bus. There are two sets of doors, one in the center of the bus and one at the front; there are four windows seen on the right side of the bus and a large window at the front. The wheels and a strip under the front window are black. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
