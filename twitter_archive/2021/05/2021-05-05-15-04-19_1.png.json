    "description": "A collection of circles in several overlapping formations: there is a roughly oblong formation at the top; the main formation is three lines of circles making up a Y-shape; there is a triangle of circles halfway down the line of circles; and finally, there is a horizontal line of circles at the bottom. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a thin pale triangle at the very top of the whole formation and a dark purple triangle halfway down the Y-shape part of the formation.",
