    "description": "A collection of circles in several distinct formations. There is a small bullet-shaped formation at the very bottom; there is an almond shaped formation at the very top; the main formation is shaped like a thin rectangle with a sideways V-shape attached to the end. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark blue-green triangle in the almond formation; there are two triangles of the same hue in the center of the main formation and the bottom right of the main formation.",
