    "description": "A collection of circles in several distinct clusters: there is a parallelogram-shaped formation at the very top; a trapezoidal formation below and to the left of that; a half-obround formation below that and slightly to the right; a rounded triangle formation to the right of that; a line of circles extended from the rounded triangle; and another trapezoidal formation below the line. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale pink triangle in the tip of the rounded triangle formation.",
