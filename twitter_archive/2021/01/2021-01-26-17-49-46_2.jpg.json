    "description": "An illustration of a crocodile (I had to guess here; the illustrator did not give a top-down view of the snout, so it's impossible to tell) seen from the side: part of the crocodile's neck and the top of its head and snout all lie above the water and are then reflected back in the water. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
