    "description": "A collection of circles in a formation shaped similarly to an exclamation mark (the formation is tilted at a roughly 45-degree angle; the top is mostly rectangular, tapering in width slightly at the bottom and then another triangular section of the formation sits below that). Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very small light orange triangle at the top of the formation and another small, pale pink triangle in the center.",
