    "description": "An illustration of an eye chart, also known as an optotype, used to test vision impairment. The first line on the chart is a very large E. The second line is an F and a P. The third line is a T, an O, and then a Z. The fourth line is an L, potentially a D, potentially a K, and potentially another D. Past that point, the letters become indiscernible shapes. There is a green line after six lines of letters and a red line two lines of letters below that. The illustration is made out of a series of triangles of various sizes.",
