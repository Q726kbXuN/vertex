    "description": "A collection of circles in a curved line formation with a semi-circular formation on the bottom right side of the line. On the right side of the picture, below the top right of the curved line, there's a separate teardrop-shaped formation of circles. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale blue triangle in the middle of the curved line formation and a small black triangle toward the bottom.",
