    "description": "An illustration of a funnel ball set up, consisting of an off-white conical funnel with three visible tubes (one red, one dark green, and one blue) surrounding the bottom which allow a ball to pass through; the funnel sits atop an off-white pole and is rooted in four gray (presumably concrete) squares. There is a blue ball above the funnel and several green triangles on the gray squares representing blades of grass.",
