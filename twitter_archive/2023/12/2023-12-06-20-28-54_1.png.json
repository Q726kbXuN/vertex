    "description": "A collection of circles in a large roughly triangular formation pointing downwards; there is a smaller triangular formation of circles pointing upwards above the larger one, as well as a capital Y-shaped formation extending outwards from the right side of the larger triangular formation and a thin ovular formation of circles below. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very dark green triangle at the bottom of the smaller triangular formation and a pale tan triangle at the top of the thin ovular formation.",
