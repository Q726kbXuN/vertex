    "description": "A collection of circles in a thin horseshoe-shaped formation; there are three small ovular formations of circles (one to the left of the horseshoe-shaped formation, one to the right, and one below the arc) and a thin trapezoidal formation of circles bisecting the horseshoe-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a thin, pale blue triangle toward the bottom left end of the horseshoe-shaped formation and another thin, pale blue triangle to the right of the center of the thin trapezoidal formation.",
