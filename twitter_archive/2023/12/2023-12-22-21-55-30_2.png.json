    "description": "An illustration of a motion picture camera: there is a handle folded flat against the body of the camera on the left side which allows the person recording to crank the film forward or backward, the lens of the camera is fully extended, and there is a small rectangular viewfinder above the lens. The design is possibly modeled after that of the Paillard Bolex, though I couldn't find an exact match in my searches. The camera sits atop a pistol grip which allows the person filming to hold the camera steady with one hand.",
