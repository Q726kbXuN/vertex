    "description": "A collection of circles in a very thin teardrop-shaped formation with the point on the bottom; there are five thin lines of circles extending outwards from around the teardrop-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very thin, pale brown triangle at the bottom of the line of circles extending outwards from the top left of the teardrop-shaped formation and a very thin, slightly darker pale brown triangle at the top of the line of circles extending outwards from the bottom right of the teardrop-shaped formation.",
