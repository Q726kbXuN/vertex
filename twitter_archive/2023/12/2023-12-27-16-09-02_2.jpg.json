    "description": "An illustration of a manila folder with the words \"TOP SECRET\" written in all capitals and red font, outlined by a thick-bordered red rectangle, stamped along the bottom of the cover. The folder is filled with several pieces of paper and taped to the top of the cover is a square photograph of a person. The photograph shows the person from the chest up: they have brown hair that goes past the forehead and a triangular brown moustache but no other discernible facial features; they are also wearing a light blue shirt.",
