    "description": "A collection of circles in a tilted rectangular formation with a semicircular bottom; there is also a convex triangular-shaped formation below the rectangular formation and an upside-down capital T-shaped formation below that. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a black triangle at the top of the tilted rectangular formation and a very small light brown triangle in the center of the convex triangular-shaped formation.",
