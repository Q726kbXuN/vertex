    "description": "An illustration of an FBI agent's credentials held in a black folding wallet case: at the top of the case is the agent's identification card with a blue seal surrounded by a gold ring on the left, the letters FBI in blue in the center, and the agent's photo on the right; at the bottom of the case on the left is a white square with a thick blue bottom border and a golden badge on the right. (Upon researching FBI credentials, the white square with the thick blue bottom border on the bottom left of the wallet case is a card that says the following: \"Such is charged with duty of investigation violations of the laws of the United States collection evidence in case in which the United States is or maybe a party in interest and performing other duties imposed by law\" and the current FBI Director's signature.)",
