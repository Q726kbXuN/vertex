    "description": "A collection of circles in a teardrop-shaped formation with a flattened top and the point at the bottom; there is also a thin line of circles that connects to a flattened ovular formation of circles below the flattened teardrop-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is very small, pale blue triangle toward the top right corner of the flattened teardrop-shaped formation and a darker blue triangle toward the bottom.",
