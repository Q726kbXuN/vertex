    "description": "A collection of circles in a rounded quadrilateral-shaped formation, with a taller left end that tapers to a narrower right end; there is also a curved triangular formation of circles that extends upwards from the center of the rectangular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale tan triangle on the left side of the quadrilateral-shaped formation and a pale purplish-blue triangle in the center of the quadrilateral-shaped formation where it meets the triangular formation of circles.",
