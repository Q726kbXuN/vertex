    "description": "A collection of circles in a right angle-shaped formation with the horizontal section at the top and the vertical section extending downwards from the left; there is a very thin triangular formation extending from the bottom of the vertical section and the formation gets more circular where the two sections meet. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark orange triangle in the circular area where the horizontal and vertical sections meet and a lighter orange triangle in the center of the vertical section.",
