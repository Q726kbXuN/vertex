    "description": "An illustration of six red dice, each with a different number of sides though no numbers are visible on any of the faces, cascading down as if all thrown at once; the top die is an octahedron, the one below that a tetrahedron, then a pentagonal trapezohedron, a cube, and a dodecahedron, with an icosahedron in the foreground. Sets of dice of this design are most frequently used in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. ",
