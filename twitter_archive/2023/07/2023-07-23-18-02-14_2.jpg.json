    "description": "An illustration of a hunter using a bow and arrows to hunt two hooved animals (possibly deer, gazelles, or antelopes), illustrated in the style of cave paintings left behind by early humans. The hunter is in the top left of the picture, holding a bow with the right arm drawn back; the animal below it has two very thin triangles (likely representing rudimentary arrows) stuck into its back while the other animal with horns or antlers runs away.",
