    "description": "A collection of circles in three distinct formations: there are two angular formations shaped like less than (<) and greater than (>) signs on top and a skinny crescent-shaped formation with the arc facing upwards below the other two formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a brown triangle below the center of the greater than sign-shaped formation and a darker brown triangle in the center of the crescent-shaped formation.",
