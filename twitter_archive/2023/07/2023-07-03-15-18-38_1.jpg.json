    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly diamond-shaped formation with a wider bottom than top; there is also a thin rectangular formation of circles extending outwards from the right side of the diamond-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale brown triangle on the left side of the diamond-shaped formation and a very small light orange triangle toward the bottom right corner. ",
