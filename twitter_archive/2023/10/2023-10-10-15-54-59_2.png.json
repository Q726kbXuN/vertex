    "description": "An illustration of an elevator with the doors slid halfway open to reveal part of the car inside: the frame of the door is silver and the doors are light blue; the top half of the interior wall of the car is a dark purple and the bottom half is light blue with a silver handlebar going across it. To the right of the door frame are two buttons stacked vertically, one with a red arrowhead pointing upwards and the other with a red arrowhead pointing downwards. Above the frame is a black screen; on the right side of the screen is a red triangle pointing upwards, indicating that the elevator is ascending.",
