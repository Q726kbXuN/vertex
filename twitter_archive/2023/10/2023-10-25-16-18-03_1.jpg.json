    "description": "A collection of circles in a roughly almond-shaped formation that tapers on the left side into a very thin point; there is also a thick hook-shaped formation extending out from the right side of the formation, a squat trapezoidal formation below the almond-shaped formation, and a small ovular formation to the right of the trapezoidal formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light brown triangle at the center top of the almond-shaped formation.",
