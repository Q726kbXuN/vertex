    "description": "A collection of circles in a very skinny, roughly capital L-shaped formation turned clockwise with two small circular formations below that. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very pale purplish-blue triangle to the right of the center of the capital L-shaped formation and another thin pale purplish-blue triangle extending outwards from the rightmost small circular formation.",
