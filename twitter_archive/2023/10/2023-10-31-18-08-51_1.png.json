    "description": "A collection of circles in a long diamond-shaped formation with longer top sides than bottom side; there is also a small rectangular formation extending downwards from the bottom of the diamond-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very dark red triangle to the right of the center of the diamond-shaped formation and another very dark red triangle toward the bottom.",
