    "description": "A collection of circles in a small circular formation; below that is a triangular formation of circles pointing downwards with a slightly arched rectangular formation of circles at the top left of the triangular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very small yellow triangle on the right side of the circular formation and a very dark gray triangle where the arched rectangular formation meets the triangular formation. ",
