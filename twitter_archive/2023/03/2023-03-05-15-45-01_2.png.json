    "description": "An illustration of a tablet computer: it has a thick black border and a screen with a blue and purple background. On the screen, there are two large squares stacked atop one another along the left side (the top one white and golden yellow, the bottom two shades of pink) and two smaller squares stacked atop one another below the bottom square (the top pink and the bottom golden yellow) alongside a long rectangle that is the same length as the two smaller squares (one-third golden yellow and two-thirds white) representing different apps the user can access on the tablet. There is also a long thin rectangle that is golden yellow at the top and pink at the bottom on the righthand side of the screen. A pink stylus hovers over the center of the tablet.",
