    "description": "A collection of circles in a formation shaped like a rectangular prism with a rounded right end; there is also a distinct formation of circles shaped like two flat ovals connected by a thick rectangle in the center of the prism formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a pale purple triangle at the top of the whole formation and a very dark blue triangle on the right side.",
