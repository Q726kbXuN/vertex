    "description": "A collection of circles in a V-shaped formation with a bulging ovular formation of circles on the bottom right side of the V-shaped formation; there is also a trapezoidal formation, with the wider end on top, attached to the bottom of the V-shaped formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark green triangle in the center of the V-shaped formation and a slightly lighter green triangle below the first.",
