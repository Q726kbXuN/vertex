    "description": "A collection of circles in a small rectangular formation with a short line of circles extending to the left from the top left corner of the formation and three long lines extending from the right side: one diagonally up toward the top right corner of the picture, one straight out to the right, and one diagonally down toward the bottom right corner of the picture. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a beige triangle on the left side of the rectangular formation and slightly darker beige triangle on the right side.",
