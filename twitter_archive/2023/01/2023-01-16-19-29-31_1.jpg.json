    "description": "A collection of circles in two conjoined circular formations: there is a large circular formation with a smaller one attached on the top left side. There are also two small diamond-shaped formations above the conjoined circular formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very small pink triangle at the bottom of one of the diamond-shaped formations and a pale blue triangle where the two circular formations meet.",
