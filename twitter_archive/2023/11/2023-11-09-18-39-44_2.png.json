    "description": "An illustration of a box of instant macaroni and cheese with the top ripped halfway open; the box is mostly blue with the bottom fourth of the box a bright orange and there is a dark blue circle on the front of the box with a white flattened hexagon at the top of the circle and an orange arch at the bottom. To the left of the box is a white packet of processed cheese powder with one end ripped almost all the way off. In front of the cheese packet and box are three lone macaroni noodles. The design of the box is reminiscent of Kraft Mac & Cheese.",
