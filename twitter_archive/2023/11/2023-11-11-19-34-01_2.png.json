    "description": "An illustration of an early model aircraft; the design seems closest to that of the Wright Flyer, invented by the Wright Brothers. The airplane consists of two long parallel wings, a front elevator used for controlling the height of the plane, and a rear rudder. The Wright Flyer model also held a gasoline engine, which is not seen in the illustration because it is seen slightly from above.",
