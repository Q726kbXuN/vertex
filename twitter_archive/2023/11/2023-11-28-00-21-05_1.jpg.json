    "description": "A collection of circles in a small circular formation atop a roughly pentagonal formation that stretches downwards and tapers, connecting to another roughly pentagonal formation of circles; below that is a flat ovular formation of circles. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a blue triangle in the center of the large pentagonal formation and a light greenish-blue triangle on the left side of the ovular formation.",
