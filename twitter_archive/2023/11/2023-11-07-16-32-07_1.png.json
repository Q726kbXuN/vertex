    "description": "A collection of circles in a cylindrical formation; there is a long, thin hook-shaped formation of circles extending upwards from the top right of the cylindrical formation, a short line of circles extending upwards from the top, a slightly curved line of circles extending outwards from the top left, and a small curved line of circles extending outwards from the center left. Each circle has a different number in the center how many lines stem from that point. There is a small brown triangle at the top of the cylindrical formation and a light yellowish-green triangle at the bottom.",
