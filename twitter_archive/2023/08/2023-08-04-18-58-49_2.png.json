    "description": "An illustration of two masks, each colored grayish blue on the left side and pale orange on the right, split evenly down the middle; both masks has holes for the wearer's eyes and mouth. The mask on the left has a scowling expression with an open mouth and the mask on the right has a smiling expression. These two masks are also known as \"sock and buskin,\" two symbols of comedy (sock) and tragedy (buskin); the title of the puzzle (\"Melpomene and Thalia\") is a reference to the Greek muses of tragedy and comedy, respectively, who are often depicted holding these masks.",
