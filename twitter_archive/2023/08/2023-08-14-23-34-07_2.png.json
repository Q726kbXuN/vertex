    "description": "An illustration of a painting consisting several large rectangles in various shades of red; nested inside the red rectangles are various sized gray and beige rectangles. The painting is similar to the work \"Untitled Variant/Adobe (Grey, Black, Red)\" (1947) by the artist Josef Albers. The illustration is not an exact match to \"Untitled Variant/Adobe (Grey, Black, Red)\" because there were many variations of this painting consisting of different colors.",
