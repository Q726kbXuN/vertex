    "description": "A collection of circles in a very large, parallelogram-shaped formation; the formation is so large that not all the circles are visible on the screen. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very thin, dark blue triangle toward the top corner of the formation and a pale red triangle toward the bottom. There is also a single black line extending downwards from the circle at the top of the dark blue triangle to another circle; this is not part of the starting puzzle, but rather an error on my behalf when screenshotting.",
