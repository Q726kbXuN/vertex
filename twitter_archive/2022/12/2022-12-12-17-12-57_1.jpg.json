    "description": "A collection of circles in the shape of a laboratory flask (a circular pyramid base that tapers upwards into a cylinder) surrounded by four formations of circles in the shape of spherical lollipops (circular heads with lines of circles extending downwards). Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a yellow triangle in the center of the flask-shaped formation and a blueish-gray triangle at the bottom.",
