    "description": "A collection of circles in a cylindrical formation that tapers to a rounded edge at the top; there is also a thick curved line of circles extending from the top to the bottom of the right side of the cylindrical formation and a thin straight line of circles extending upwards from the top. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a white triangle where the line of circles meets the cylindrical formation and a brown triangle in the center of the cylindrical formation.",
