    "description": "An illustration of a mechanical model of the Solar System (also known as an orrery): the sun sits at the center: to its immediate left is a small orb that is pale blue and purpleish-blue; to its right is a small orb that is pale pink and purpleish-blue; further to the left is a yellow, orange, and pink planet with a purpleish-blue ring; even further left is a pale pink, pale blue, and purpleish-blue planet; behind the sun is a large pale blue and purpleish-blue orb; and all the way to the right is a large pale pink, purpleish-blue, and orange planet. The arms, stand, and base of the model are varying shades of gray and light pink; the planet on one arm is obscured by the sun.",
