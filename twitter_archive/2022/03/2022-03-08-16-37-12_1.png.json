    "description": "A collection of circles in four distinct formations stacked one atop the other: the first is an upside-down capital-T shape with rounded ends, the second and fourth are thin lines of circles, and the third is a small ovular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light brown triangle in the middle of the upside-down capital-T shaped formation and a darker brown triangle on the left side of the second formation.",
