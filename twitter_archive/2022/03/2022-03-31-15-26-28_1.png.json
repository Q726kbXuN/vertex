    "description": "A collection of circles in a thin rectangular formation with a slightly curved bottom and a top that tapers up into a triangular point; there is also a small upside-down teardrop-shaped formation to the right and slightly above the main formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a bright pink triangle toward the top of the tapered rectangular formation and a larger bright pink triangle in the center of the teardrop-shaped formation.",
