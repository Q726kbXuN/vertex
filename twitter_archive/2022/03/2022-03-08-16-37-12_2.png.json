    "description": "An illustration of five samaras, also known as helicopter seeds, as they fall down; they have dark brown round fruit on one end which is connected to a fibrous, papery tissue such that each seed is shaped like a tear drop. Samaras are sometimes called helicopter seeds or whirlybirds because when they fall, they spin around rapidly.",
