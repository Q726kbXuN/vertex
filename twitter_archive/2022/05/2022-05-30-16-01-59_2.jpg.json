    "description": "An illustration of a North American beaver crouched before a tree trunk, which it has gnawed at in such a way that the top of the trunk and the bottom of the trunk are conjoined by thin points; the top of the trunk is about to tip over. The title of the puzzle (\"Symbol of Oregon\") is a reference to Oregon's nickname, The Beaver State; the state mammal is also the North American beaver.",
