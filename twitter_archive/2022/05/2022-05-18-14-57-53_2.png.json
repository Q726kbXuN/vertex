    "description": "An illustration of the Chicagoan sculpture \"Cloud Gate,\" also known as \"the Bean:\" it is a large, stainless steel sculpture with no visible seams on the outside, in the shape of a bean with a high arch in the center of the bottom. The surface of the sculpture reflects the Chicago skyline, with three distorted reflections of buildings on the right side. The title of the puzzle (\"In the Loop\") is a reference to Cloud Gate's location in Millennium Park, which is in the Chicago Loop area.",
