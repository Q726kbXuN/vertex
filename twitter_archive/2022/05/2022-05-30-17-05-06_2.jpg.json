    "description": "An illustration of a Skee-Ball machine: one ball sits in the center of the lowest arched rail below a bullseye ring. There are three ball pockets, two in the top corners and one in the center of the bullseye ring. There are three balls sitting in the return slot on the right side of the alley. The alley, bumpers, and backboard are varying shades of red and orange; the bullseye rings, top board, and baseboard are very pale yellow; the score interface and balls are various shades of dark and light blue.",
