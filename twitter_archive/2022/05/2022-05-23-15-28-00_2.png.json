The bottom card has the magnetic strip facing up and is teal colored. The top card shows the golden chip on the left side, a logo in the top right corner (two overlapping square diamonds: the left is red, the right is blue, and the square diamond where they overlap is yellow), and several shapes on the bottom representing the card's numbers, owner's name, and expiration date.",
