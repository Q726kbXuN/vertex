    "description": "An illustration of a bowl of ramen: the bowl itself is brown with a pink border along the top rim of the outside and above the bowl floats a pair of chopsticks holding a singular noodle. The bowl is filled with a light yellowish and beige-colored broth, two slices of (presumably) chashu pork belly, two slices of narutomaki (cured fish surimi in a white cloud shape with a pink spiral in the middle), half of a boiled egg, and three sheets of dried seaweed (also known as nori).",
