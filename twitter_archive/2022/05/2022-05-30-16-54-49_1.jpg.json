Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a thin, pale blue triangle in the center of the triangular formation and another thin, pale blue triangle in the bottom right corner; there is also a dark purplish-pink triangle to the right of the center of the rectangular formation.
