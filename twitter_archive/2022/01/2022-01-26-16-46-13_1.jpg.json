    "description": "A collection of circles in an hourglass-shaped formation that tapers up to have a triangular top; there is also a thin line of circles that extends from the bottom of the hourglass-shaped formation that then branches out into a three-pronged Y-shape formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a light purple triangle at the bottom of the hourglass-shaped formation and a pale red triangle at the bottom of the three-pronged Y-shaped formation.",
