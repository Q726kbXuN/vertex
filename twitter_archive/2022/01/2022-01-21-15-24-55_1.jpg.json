    "description": "A collection of circles in an upside-down triangular formation above a flat, wide ovular formation; a thin line of circles extends from the top left corner of the triangle and another thin line of circles connects the triangular and ovular formations. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a very pale blue triangle at the bottom of the triangular formation and a very pale yellow triangle at the bottom of the line of circles connecting the two main formations.",
