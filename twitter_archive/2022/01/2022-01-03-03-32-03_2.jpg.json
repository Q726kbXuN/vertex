    "description": "An illustration of a drawing board, specifically one of an architect's table design: the surface of the table is tilted at an angle which can be adjusted by the ring attached to the back of the table; the table is supported by a set legs that form an A-shape. The surface and frame of the table are varying shades of red. The bottom edge of the table, which is perpendicular to the surface so as to catch writing tools, and the ring at the back of the table are varying shades of blue and off-white. There is also a thin blue rectangular shape on the surface of the table that is perhaps meant to represent a ruler and a blue right triangle shape that is perhaps a triangular ruler.",
