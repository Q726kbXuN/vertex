    "description": "A collection of circles in a closed scissors-shaped formation: that is to say, two circular formations, one atop the other, connected by a triangular formation between them. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem form that point. There is a light orange triangle on the left side of the triangular part of the formation and a pale blue triangle on the bottom of the bottom circular formation.",
