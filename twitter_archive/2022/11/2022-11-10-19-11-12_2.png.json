    "description": "An illustration of a round mechanical device, made of gold or brass: it appears similar to a pocket watch, but it only has one hand and a small, golden ring with four spikes at the top pointing inwards. There is a loop at the top of the device, presumably to attach it to a chain. The title of the puzzle (\"Historical measurements\") implies that this device is used to measure something, though I admittedly am not sure what.",
