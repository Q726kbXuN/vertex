    "description": "An illustration of a cornhole board, a rectangular wooden board held up at an angle with a single hole toward the top. There are four bean bags (two red and two blue) scattered on and around the board: one of the red bean bags is close to the hole and the other is just short of the board, while one blue bean bag is on the left edge of the board and the other is just past the board. There are several triangles of various green shades surrounding the board, representing tufts of grass.",
