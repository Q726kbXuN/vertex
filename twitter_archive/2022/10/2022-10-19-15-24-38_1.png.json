    "description": "A collection of circles in a triangular formation: at each corner of the triangular formation is a small circular formation. There are also two circles, one atop the other, a short distance away from each side of the triangular formation. Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a black triangle at the bottom of the top circular formation and a thin black triangle extending outwards from the right side of the triangular formation.",
