    "description": "An illustration of an optical illusion called a Kanizsa's triangle: it consists of three black circles with a triangular wedge missing from each one and three thin black caret-shaped (^) lines. The caret-shaped lines are arranged in such a way to form a downward facing triangle with a gap in each side; the circles are arranged in such a way that the missing wedges in each form the illusion of a bright white triangle overlapping the triangle formed by the caret-shaped lines.",
