    "description": "An illustration of civil rights activist Rosa Parks, seen from the chest up. She is seen within a gray square, which could represent either a photo or painting of her or perhaps it represents a window on a bus through which she is seen. She faces the left side of the square and has on a cloche hat, glasses, and a coat. Above the square is a rectangular shape with rounded edges which could represent another window or a plaque above the square.",
