    "description": "An illustration of a box of assorted chocolate bonbon candies: the box is mostly white and on the lid, there is a red square on top of a blue rectangle with a thinner white rectangle inset in the bottom left corner of the blue rectangle. The lid covers some of the box, revealing some of the left side of the box's contents: there is a gold-colored tray with insets of various shapes where pieces of chocolate bonbons would lie. To the left of the box is a singular bonbon shaped like a truncated cone. The title of the puzzle (\"Metaphor for life\") is a reference to a line from the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump:\" \"My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"",
