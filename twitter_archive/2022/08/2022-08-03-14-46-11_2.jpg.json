    "description": "An illustration of a grasshopper; the top half of its body and its hind legs are mostly various shades of green, while the back half of its body and its front four legs are various shades of brown. The title of the puzzle (\"Patience …\") is a reference to Aesop's fable \"The Ant and the Grasshopper,\" which tells the story of a grasshopper who spends his summer singing and dancing rather than storing up food for the winter.",
