    "description": "An illustration of a coin box, a video game object most commonly seen in the Nintendo Mario games: it is a golden box with a question mark on each side of the box, an orange bottom, and a singular gold coin floating above the box. In several video games in the Mario franchise, players can gain at least one golden coin from a coin box by hitting it; sometimes a great amount of coins can come out. The box and the coin are drawn in the style known as 8-bit pixel art, such that they look 2D.",
