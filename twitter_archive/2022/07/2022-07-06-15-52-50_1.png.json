    "description": "A collection of circles in a triangular formation attached to a long rectangular formation at the bottom (the two are connected in a way that they form a thick Y-shaped formation). Each circle has a different number in the center denoting how many lines stem from that point. There is a dark blueish-gray triangle on the left side of the formation in the center and a larger dark blueish-gray triangle in the bottom right corner.",
