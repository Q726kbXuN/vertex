    "description": "An illustration of a LOVE sculpture, designed by American pop artist Robert Indiana. The sculpture consists of large 3-D letters L and O stacked atop V and E; the faces of the letters are red: the outsides of the L, O, and E are blue while the inside of the O and the outsides of the V are green. The O is tilted slightly toward the right. These iconic sculptures can be seen in various cities around the United States and the world.",
